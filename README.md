# Numerical-Methods
Repository to collect projects from numerical methods.
There's a lot of python code implementation of abstract methods used in numerical methods. Matrix norms. LU, QR, LUP, Cholesky matrixes decompositions.
Laboratories require to pass 30% of tasks given on them. Each task is done at folder named Num[n], where [n] is 1, ... , 10.
At the end, I will add a comment what grade i received. 
Enjoy ðŸ’¥
